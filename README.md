# moodle_db_backup
A shellscript to perform backups of a Moodle instance's database requiring only the location of the Moodle install to be specified, the relevant details being automatically gleaned from config.php
NOTE: it's not finished yet, not yet functional, only grabs details from config.php so far and backups up nothing from nowhere yet
